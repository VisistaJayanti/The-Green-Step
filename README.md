The objectives of our project are as follows: -

-	Develop walkable pathways under metro stations that are constructed above sandy areas in Dubai.

-	Design and implement a mobile application capable of tracing the routes taken by pedestrians on the walkable pathways via GPS technology.

-	The primary function of this application is to track and monitor the step count of individuals on the walkable pathways. Subsequently, this step count will be converted into a certain number of points, which will then be translated into a specific monetary value. This money can be used to recharge the NOL cards, prompting and facilitating an easier utilization of public transport services.

-	You can walk to earn RTA rides.

This project covers two important aspects:

-	Walkable pathways to promote walkability
-	Benefits in terms of NOL card recharges encouraging the use of public transport

A small gratitude to begin with

H.H. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan said:
“Protecting the environment should not be seen only as an issue for the government and official authorities but as a concern to all of us.”

In that way, we students are extremely honored to be provided with a great platform like this to share and present our ideas to address the issues of sustainability in our country.

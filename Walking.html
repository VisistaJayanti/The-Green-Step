          This application initiative encourages individuals to walk over short distances. The application has start and stop button , on being enabled , individuals can walk distances from initial location to the final location tracked by GPS and a small value of money will be added in their NOL card which can inturn be used for public transport such as metro and bus. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
         The number of steps calculated will be converted to money acting as an incentive for walking and rewarding users with extra NOL card credit. The application encourages individuals to travel short distances by walking and provides notifications about the possible carbon emissions they are contributing to save by walking rather than using transport providing motivation.

          According to a <a href="https://www.greenprophet.com/2010/08/walk-united-arab-emirates/" target="_blank">study</a> it was found 4% of individuals living in UAE walk and the average is only 4,515 steps a day. Hence to accelerate the chances of short distance walking, this application initiative is created. The application begins crediting individuals only after a threshold of 3000 steps is completed rewarding them 0.25 fills, 5000 rewards them 0.50 fills, 10,000 rewards them 1 dirham and so on. The minimum requirement of steps is 3000 steps and maximum number of steps calculated is 15,000 steps rewarding a maximum of 1.5 dirhams.
